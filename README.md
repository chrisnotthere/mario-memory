# Mario Memory Game

This project is a memory card flip game. It's designed as a learning exercise to get hands-on experience with Redux, TypeScript, and React. The game logic is managed using Redux, and the entire application is written in TypeScript.

## Learning Objectives

The main learning objectives of this project are:

1. **Redux**: To understand how to manage and manipulate state using Redux and its toolkit. 

2. **TypeScript**: To gain experience in writing React applications in TypeScript, and appreciate the benefits of a statically typed language.

3. **React**: To practice using React functional components and hooks, and understand how they can be used with Redux and TypeScript.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to incorporate a PostgreSQL database into this project to keep track of high scores, stats, and other game data.

I will also be adding difficulty settings at some stage.
